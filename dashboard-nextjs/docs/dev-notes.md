# Development Notes - July 16, 2025

## Today's Work Summary

### Completed Tasks
1. ✅ Fixed nested layout issues by removing redundant `DashboardLayout` from pages
2. ✅ Updated resume-screening page to match original React version with query parameter handling
3. ✅ Rewrote candidate management page to match original React version with advanced filters
4. ✅ Started interview scheduling page rewrite to match original React version

### Current Issue: Interview Pages Implementation

#### Problem Description
The interview scheduling page (`/interviews`) needs to be completely rewritten to match the original React version from `dashboard/src/pages/InterviewScheduling.jsx`. The current Next.js version is too basic and missing all the advanced functionality.

#### Original React Features to Implement
1. **Advanced Conflict Detection System**
   - Real-time conflict checking between interviewers
   - Candidate availability validation
   - Busy slot detection
   - Conflict severity levels (high/medium/low)

2. **Interview Panel Management**
   - Pre-configured interview panels (Technical, Design, Leadership, Full)
   - Panel member assignment
   - Duration and description management
   - Expertise tracking

3. **Interviewer Data Structure**
   - Detailed interviewer profiles with availability
   - Department and role information
   - Expertise tags
   - Contact information

4. **Calendar and List Views**
   - Toggle between calendar and list views
   - Calendar with conflict indicators
   - Today's schedule sidebar
   - Filter options (All, Conflicts, Confirmed, Pending)

5. **Interview Scheduling Modal**
   - Panel selection interface
   - Date and time picker with conflict detection
   - Optimal slot finding algorithm
   - Interviewer availability display
   - Candidate confirmation status

6. **Statistics Dashboard**
   - Today's interviews count
   - Weekly interview count
   - Conflict count
   - Active panels count
   - Completed interviews count

#### Technical Implementation Details

**Data Structures Needed:**
```typescript
// Interviewers with availability
const interviewers = [
  {
    id: number,
    name: string,
    role: string,
    department: string,
    email: string,
    phone: string,
    expertise: string[],
    availability: Record<string, string[]>,
    busySlots: Record<string, string[]>
  }
];

// Interview panels
const interviewPanels = [
  {
    id: number,
    name: string,
    type: string,
    members: number[],
    duration: string,
    description: string
  }
];

// Interviews with conflict tracking
const interviews = [
  {
    id: number,
    candidate: string,
    position: string,
    type: string,
    date: string,
    time: string,
    duration: string,
    interviewers: number[],
    panelId: number,
    location: string,
    isVirtual: boolean,
    status: string,
    notes: string,
    conflicts: string[],
    candidateConfirmed: boolean,
    interviewersConfirmed: number[]
  }
];
```

**Key Functions to Implement:**
1. `detectConflicts(interview)` - Check for scheduling conflicts
2. `findOptimalSlots(date, interviewerIds, candidateName, duration)` - Find best available times
3. `getStatusColor(status)` - Color coding for interview status
4. `getInterviewTypeColor(type)` - Color coding for interview types
5. `getConflictSeverityColor(severity)` - Color coding for conflict severity

**UI Components Needed:**
1. `InterviewCard` - Detailed interview display with conflict info
2. `ScheduleModal` - Complex scheduling interface
3. Calendar view with conflict indicators
4. Statistics cards
5. Panel overview section
6. Available time slots grid

#### Current Status
- ✅ Basic structure and data setup completed
- ✅ Header and statistics cards implemented
- ✅ View toggle and filters added
- ✅ InterviewCard component created
- ✅ ScheduleModal component created
- ✅ Calendar view with conflict detection
- ✅ List view with filtering
- ✅ Panel overview section
- ✅ Available time slots display

#### Remaining Issues
1. **TypeScript Errors**: Need to add proper type definitions
2. **Import Issues**: Some Heroicons imports may need adjustment
3. **State Management**: Ensure all state updates work correctly
4. **Modal Functionality**: Test scheduling modal interactions
5. **Conflict Detection**: Verify conflict detection logic works properly

#### Next Steps for Home Work
1. Fix any TypeScript compilation errors
2. Test all interactive features (scheduling, editing, filtering)
3. Verify conflict detection works correctly
4. Test calendar view interactions
5. Ensure all modals open/close properly
6. Add any missing functionality from original React version

#### Files Modified Today
- `src/app/candidates/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite to match original
- `src/app/resume-screening/page.tsx` - Added query parameter handling
- `src/app/interviews/page.tsx` - Complete rewrite (in progress)

#### Original React Reference
- `dashboard/src/pages/InterviewScheduling.jsx` - 1081 lines
- Contains all the advanced functionality to replicate

#### Notes for Continuation
- The interview page is 90% complete but may have TypeScript errors
- Focus on fixing compilation issues first
- Test all interactive features thoroughly
- Ensure the scheduling modal works correctly
- Verify conflict detection displays properly
