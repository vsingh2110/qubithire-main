## Interview Pages Issue - Detailed Analysis

### Problem Summary
The interview scheduling page (`/interviews`) needs complete rewrite to match original React version. Current Next.js version is too basic and missing advanced functionality.

### Original React Features Missing
1. **Conflict Detection System**
   - Real-time conflict checking
   - Interviewer availability validation
   - Candidate availability checking
   - Busy slot detection
   - Conflict severity levels

2. **Interview Panel Management**
   - Pre-configured panels (Technical, Design, Leadership, Full)
   - Panel member assignment
   - Duration tracking
   - Expertise management

3. **Advanced UI Components**
   - Calendar view with conflict indicators
   - List view with filtering
   - Interview cards with detailed info
   - Scheduling modal with optimal slot detection
   - Statistics dashboard

### Technical Implementation Status

#### ✅ Completed
- Basic page structure
- Header with conflict detection toggle
- Statistics cards (Today's interviews, This week, Conflicts, Active panels, Completed)
- View toggle (Calendar/List)
- Filter dropdown
- InterviewCard component with conflict display
- ScheduleModal component with panel selection
- Calendar view with conflict indicators
- List view with filtering
- Panel overview section
- Available time slots grid

#### ❌ Issues to Fix
1. **TypeScript Errors**: Need proper type definitions
2. **Import Issues**: Heroicons imports may need adjustment
3. **State Management**: Verify all state updates work
4. **Modal Functionality**: Test scheduling interactions
5. **Conflict Detection**: Verify logic works correctly

### Data Structures Implemented
```typescript
// Interviewers with availability tracking
const interviewers = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Sarah Wilson",
    role: "Senior Developer",
    department: "Engineering",
    email: "sarah.wilson@company.com",
    phone: "+1 (555) 123-4567",
    expertise: ["React", "Node.js", "System Design"],
    availability: { "2024-01-20": ["9:00 AM", "10:00 AM", ...] },
    busySlots: { "2024-01-20": ["10:00 AM"] }
  }
];

// Interview panels
const interviewPanels = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: "Technical Panel",
    type: "Technical Interview",
    members: [1, 2],
    duration: "1 hour",
    description: "Technical assessment with coding and system design"
  }
];

// Interviews with conflict tracking
const interviews = [
  {
    id: 1,
    candidate: "John Smith",
    position: "Senior React Developer",
    type: "Technical Interview",
    date: "2024-01-20",
    time: "10:00 AM",
    duration: "1 hour",
    interviewers: [1, 2],
    panelId: 1,
    location: "Conference Room A",
    isVirtual: false,
    status: "scheduled",
    notes: "Focus on React and system design",
    conflicts: [],
    candidateConfirmed: true,
    interviewersConfirmed: [1, 2]
  }
];
```

### Key Functions Implemented
1. `detectConflicts(interview)` - Check for scheduling conflicts
2. `findOptimalSlots(date, interviewerIds, candidateName, duration)` - Find best available times
3. `getStatusColor(status)` - Color coding for interview status
4. `getInterviewTypeColor(type)` - Color coding for interview types
5. `getConflictSeverityColor(severity)` - Color coding for conflict severity

### UI Components Created
1. **InterviewCard** - Shows interview details with conflict info
2. **ScheduleModal** - Complex scheduling interface with panel selection
3. **Calendar View** - Monthly calendar with conflict indicators
4. **List View** - Filterable list of interviews
5. **Statistics Cards** - Dashboard metrics
6. **Panel Overview** - Interview panel management
7. **Time Slots Grid** - Available time slots display

### Current File Status
- **File**: `src/app/interviews/page.tsx`
- **Lines**: ~514 lines (original React was 1081 lines)
- **Status**: 90% complete, needs TypeScript fixes

### Next Steps for Home Work
1. **Fix TypeScript Errors**
   - Add proper type definitions
   - Fix import issues
   - Resolve compilation errors

2. **Test Functionality**
   - Test scheduling modal
   - Verify conflict detection
   - Check calendar interactions
   - Test filtering options

3. **Verify Features**
   - Panel selection works
   - Time slot selection works
   - Conflict detection displays correctly
   - Interviewer availability shows properly

4. **Add Missing Features**
   - Any functionality missing from original React version
   - Additional error handling
   - Performance optimizations

### Original React Reference
- **File**: `dashboard/src/pages/InterviewScheduling.jsx`
- **Lines**: 1081 lines
- **Features**: Complete interview scheduling system with conflict detection

### Notes for Continuation
- Focus on fixing TypeScript compilation errors first
- Test all interactive features thoroughly
- Ensure the scheduling modal works correctly
- Verify conflict detection displays properly
- Check that all state updates work as expected
